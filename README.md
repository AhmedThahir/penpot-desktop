## About Penpot Desktop
Mostly an embed using a WebView, but I plan to add more onto it later on.

This is very new, so it's not perfect, but it works(at least).

## Features
- Use Penpot Desktop on your own server if you're self-hosting
- Dark mode in Dashboard

## Features Planned for the Future

## First launch

### MacOS
(This is a temporary work-around until the issue is resolved.)
When you launch the Penpot desktop app for the first time, macOS (from approx. version 11 and higher) may not allow it [to launch for security reasons](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/12.0/mac/12.0).

You may see an error message saying Penpot-Desktop "...cannot Be Opened Because the Developer Cannot Be Verified'. Until this has been resolved a work-around is:

1. Navigate to the application in Finder
2. Right-click the application icon and select "Open"
3. Confirm in the dialog which will be shown

The Penpot-Desktop app is now saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.
