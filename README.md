## About Penpot Desktop
Mostly an embed using a WebView, but I plan to add more onto it later on.

This is very new, so it's not perfect, but it works(at least).

## Features
- Use Penpot Desktop on your own server if you're self-hosting
- Dark mode in Dashboard
- Tabs

## Features Planned for the Future
 - Login via Web Browser

## Downloads
> macOS does not include auto update, you'll need to manually update the app.

[Windows](https://updates.korbsstudio.com/penpot-desktop/Penpot%20Desktop%20-%20Setup.exe)

## Installation
### Windows
After downloading the setup file for Penpot Desktop, you'll notice a [pop up](https://i.imgur.com/yNjUYg7.png) when opening the setup file.

The pop up should be Smartscreen saying "Windows protected your PC" and "Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecoginzed app from start...". This is because the setup file for Penpot Desktop is unsigned and Windows will do this for all unsigned files, whether if the file is actually safe to use or not. 

Just click "Show More" and then "Run anyway".

### MacOS
(This is a temporary work-around until the issue is resolved.)
When you launch the Penpot desktop app for the first time, macOS (from approx. version 11 and higher) may not allow it [to launch for security reasons](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/12.0/mac/12.0).

You may see an error message saying Penpot-Desktop "...cannot Be Opened Because the Developer Cannot Be Verified'. Until this has been resolved a work-around is:

1. Navigate to the application in Finder
2. Right-click the application icon and select "Open"
3. Confirm in the dialog which will be shown

The Penpot-Desktop app is now saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.
