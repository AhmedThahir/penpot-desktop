Q: Does Penpot Desktop support offline use? If so, how do I use it offline?

A: Penpot Desktop does support offline usage, you can do this by hosting Penpot on your own machine or in a local server within your home. To learn how to host Penpot yourself, please view their [official guide](https://penpot.app/self-host). Try installing with Docker or your preferrable method.

To switch Penpot Desktop to your self-hosted Penpot, click on the "Gear" icon in the upper right corner, then your Instance options, please put in where your self-hosted Penpot is. You should be able to use a local IP address, as long as you on are on the same network, an example looks like "http://192.168.1.2:9001/". If you used your own machine, where you'll also be using Penpot Desktop, then using "http://localhost:9001" should work, even without internet enabled.

Q: If an update is available, how do I get it?

A: This is done automatically on Windows and Linux, with auto update builtin from Electron Builder. We recommend that you wait at the least 1 - 2 minutes for the update to download, or depending on your internet. This usually take about 10 - 30 seconds for decent internet(200mbps).

On macOS, however, each update must be installed manually by the user themself. No, you are not required to do this on a regular basis; nevertheless, updating Penpot Desktop is recommended if you want the most up-to-date version in general. It's difficult to support macOS for auto updating at the time being.
**(In newer version from v0.2.3 and newer, auto update will be supported.)**
