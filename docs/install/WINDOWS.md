# Download and Install Penpot Desktop on Windows
Download the EXE file: https://sudovanilla.com/distribute/applications/penpot-desktop/latest/Penpot_Desktop_-_Setup.exe

## Installation
When opening the setup file, Windows will prompt a warning message indicating that the file is from an unknown publisher, this is cause by SudoVanilla not signing the setup file on each release. Signing the file is too expensive.

Simply click "Show More" and click "Open Anyway". Then install the software as normal.
