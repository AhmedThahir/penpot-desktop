# Download and Install Penpot Desktop on macOS
Download the DMG file: https://sudovanilla.com/distribute/applications/penpot-desktop/latest/Penpot.dmg

## Installation
Open the DMG file and drag the Penpot icon into the Application folder.

## First Launch
> Update June 30th, 2023: In the latest update (v0.2.33), the files have been signed and the instruction below may no longer be needed to install Penpot Desktop.

(This is a temporary work-around until the issue is resolved.)
When you launch the Penpot desktop app for the first time, macOS (from approx. version 11 and higher) may not allow it [to launch for security reasons](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/mac-help/mh40616/12.0/mac/12.0).

You may see an error message saying Penpot-Desktop "...cannot Be Opened Because the Developer Cannot Be Verified'. Until this has been resolved a work-around is:

1. Navigate to the application in Finder
2. Right-click the application icon and select "Open"
3. Confirm in the dialog which will be shown

The Penpot-Desktop app is now saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it just as you can any registered app.

**Why?**
We already mentioned that this is a security measure put in place by Apple to keep their users safe and we understand. SudoVanilla is required to have an Apple Developer Account to register Penpot Desktop and use this account to verify the DMG file. An Apple Developer account is $99/year and I can't afford this right now.

> Thanks to [Bernard Tyers](https://github.com/ei8fdb) for adding the "First Launch" section of these instructions.
