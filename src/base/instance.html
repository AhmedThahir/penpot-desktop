        <h1>What's an Instance?</h1>
        <p>An instance is a copy of Penpot running on a physical or virtual server. If you have two physical or virtual servers running a copy of Penpot, that counts as two instances.</p>
        <p>This is great for offline usage if it's local on your network, meaning that you could use something like "http://192.168.1.47:9001" to connect to it. It's also possible to host it directly on your main machine, so using "http://localhost:9001" is possible as well.</p>
        <p>Of course, you don't have to do this. You can use other existing instances of Penpot that are already running, mainly the official one provided by Penpot which is "https://design.penpot.app/".</p>
